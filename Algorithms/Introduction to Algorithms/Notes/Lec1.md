<h3>One-dimensional Version</h3>

__Straightforward Algorithm__

The straightforward algorithm is where you iterate through all the numbers and find the peak, that takes O(n) time. A better way would be to use the divide and conquer approach.

<h3>Two-dimensional Version</h3>

__Attempt # 1: Extend 1D Divide and Conquer to 2D__

Attempt #1 fails because the 2D-peak may not exist on row i.

<h2>Chapter 1: The Role of Algorithms in Computing</h2>


<h3>Algorithms</h3>

Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

An _instance of a problem_ consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.
